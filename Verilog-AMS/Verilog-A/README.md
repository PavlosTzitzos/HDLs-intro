# Verilog-A

In this folder you will find only analog circuits

# Get Started with QUCS Studio and Verilog-A models

1. Launch QUCS Studio.

2. Click on "New" in the "Projects" tab to create a new project and enter the project's name.

3. On the "Content" you can see the files inside your project create a new text file by clicking on ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94289294/227705356-aaeaa8ab-2a05-4740-bc04-d41f2a0325fd.png).

4. In this file start writing your Verilog-A code.

5. Save it with ".va" ending.

6. To be able to simulate the analog circuit you need to create a schematic on the "untitled" tab on the right side .

7. To place components first go to the "Components" tab and click on your desired component, then just move the cursor to the desired location.

8. Wires / Wire Labels can be found on the tool bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94289294/227705582-403203e9-4c81-449e-8c14-e3050102ac9a.png)

9. After done with the componets placement go to "Content" tab and click on your Verilog-A model then place it like a normal component.

10. To simulate a circuit place one simulation from the Components > simulations > ... and set the parameters

11. Simulate with F2

If you want to check your model for errors before creating the schematic run the simulation F2. It will have nothing to simulate but first thing is to check the 
Verilog-A file. More details can be found at Help > Help index (F1) > Enhanced actions > Creating user models.
