
# Verilog-AMS

Verilog-A is a subset of Verilog-AMS. That's why there are only a few Verilog-A examples and then jump right into verilog-AMS.

With every module we always have to include the constants.vams and diciplines.vams.

# QUCS Studio

Verilog-A and Verilog-AMS projects were simulated using [QUCS Studio](http://qucsstudio.de/) .
