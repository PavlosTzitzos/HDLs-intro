                    <h2>1.1 Why We Need Verilog?</h2>
                </div>
                <!-- Content for section 1.1 -->
                <div class="contents">
                    <p>In the realm of digital electronics and hardware design, precision, accuracy, and reliability are paramount. This is where Verilog steps in as a crucial tool. But why do we need Verilog in the first place? </p>
                    <ul>
                        1. Design Complexity:
                        <p>
                            Hardware designs have become increasingly complex over the years. From microprocessors to custom integrated circuits, modern electronics require intricate designs. Verilog provides a systematic and efficient way to model and describe this complexity. 
                        </p>
                        2. Simulation and Verification:
                        <p>
                            Before hardware is physically manufactured, it must be thoroughly tested and verified. Verilog allows engineers to simulate the behaviour of their designs, identifying and rectifying issues early in the design process, saving time and resources. 
                        </p>
                        3. Reusability: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog promotes the creation of reusable hardware modules. These modules can be easily integrated into larger designs, reducing redundancy and accelerating development. 
                        </p>
                        4. Flexibility and Adaptability: 
                        <p>
                            Electronics are constantly evolving. Verilog's adaptability allows designers to make changes and updates to their designs efficiently, keeping pace with technological advancements. 
                        </p>
                        5. FPGA and ASIC Development: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog is a cornerstone in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These technologies have wide-ranging applications, from consumer electronics to aerospace. 
                        </p>
                        6. Industry Standard: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog has emerged as an industry standard for hardware description. Professionals in the field are expected to have proficiency in Verilog due to its widespread use. 
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                        <p>
                            In summary, Verilog is an indispensable language that addresses the increasing complexity of hardware design. It empowers engineers and designers to create, simulate, and verify intricate electronic systems efficiently, making it a fundamental tool in the world of digital hardware design.

                    <h2>1.2 What is Verilog?</h2>
                </div>
                <!-- Content for section 1.2 -->
                <div class="contents">
                    <p>
                        Verilog is a specialized computer language designed for the precise description and modeling of digital hardware systems. It serves as a critical bridge between abstract hardware concepts and their practical implementation. Let's delve deeper into what Verilog is and its significance: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        1. Hardware Description Language (HDL): 
                        <p>
                            At its core, Verilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL). HDLs are used to specify the behavior and structure of digital circuits and systems. Verilog excels in describing not only the functionality but also the timing and hierarchical organization of hardware components. 
                        </p>
                        2. Behavioral and Structural Modeling: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog allows for both behavioral and structural modeling. Engineers can describe how a hardware component behaves (functional abstraction) and how it's physically structured (structural abstraction). This versatility is invaluable in hardware design. 
                        </p>
                        3. Simulation and Synthesis: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog plays a dual role in the design process. It enables simulation, where designers can test and validate their designs in a virtual environment. Additionally, Verilog is used in synthesis tools, which convert high-level descriptions into low-level gate-level representations that can be implemented in hardware. 
                        </p>
                        4. Event-Driven Execution: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog operates on an event-driven model, where changes in signal values trigger the execution of specific blocks of code. This makes it well-suited for modeling synchronous digital systems, where actions occur in response to clock edges. 
                        </p>
                        5. Hierarchy and Modularity: 
                        <p>
                            Hardware designs can quickly become complex. Verilog encourages a hierarchical and modular approach, where large systems are built from smaller, reusable components. This promotes clarity, reusability, and maintainability. 
                        </p>
                        6. Industry Adoption: 
                        <p>
                            Verilog has gained widespread acceptance and is commonly used in both academia and industry. Its standardization ensures compatibility across various tools and platforms. 
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In summary, Verilog is a specialized language tailored for the design, simulation, and synthesis of digital hardware systems. It provides engineers with a means to capture the intricacies of electronic circuits, facilitating both conceptual design and practical implementation.
