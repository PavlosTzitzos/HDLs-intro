# Verilog-Code
This repository is an effort to make an introduction in SystemVerilog.

If you are new in HDL start from the Verilog folder and step up to SystemVerilog which replaced Verilog.

If you are interested in Analog design with Verilog start from Verilog folder then go to Verilog-A.

If you are interesed in Mixed Signals (analog and digital) go to Verilog then to Verilog-A and then to Verilog-AMS.
